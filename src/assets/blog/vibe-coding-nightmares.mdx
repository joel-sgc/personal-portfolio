In the past year or so, AI has taken over *everything*, but especially programming, and quite frankly? I'm **tired** of acting like it's still important.

Now I won't deny that they are both useful and plentiful in nature... ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude, Llama, Grok, etc, etc, etc... Even though I've considered myself to be a pretty good developer, AI has admittedly gotten me out of many sticky situations- many of which I had no idea how to traverse.

However, I also believe it's rather important that we take this new technology with a grain of salt. While AI is quite good at explaining concepts and answering most basic questions, when faced with a unique scenario: It. Breaks. Down.

While I'm sure I'm missing some, here's a list of issues I often see within these projects:
- Lack of version control
- Unoptimized workflows
- 0 Scalability
- Security oversights
- No feature testing

Now don't get me wrong, I love that AI has brought so many people together. It's allowed everyone to integrate into new communities that would've before been hard to break into due to steep learning curves and bad documentation/instructions. There must however be a limit.

Again, AI is great, but simply holding down enter while Cursor works away is not getting you anywhere. Instead, you'll receive a bunch of AI slop that only god himself can debug successfully.
